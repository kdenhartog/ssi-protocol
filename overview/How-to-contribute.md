Contribute is as easy as making a pull request on what you believe should belong in this repository. Contributing is intended to be a lightweight process to encourage content creation. Curaration of the Pull Requests will occur through a [fist of 5](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/fist-to-five-fist-of-five) vote process by contributors of the repository. 

 After one week from the time the Pull Request was submitted if there is no votes below 3, then the pull request will be accepted as is. 

* If a vote below 3 is submitted, the disapproving voter(s) will have 1 week to submit a substantive
counterproposal that improves the pull request. At that point, the ideas in the PR are considered "tenatively
endorsed" by the contributors. New PRs can always undo something.

* "Substantive counterproposal" means you propose alternate content with a PR of
your own, either against the same repo or against the original proposer's fork--
not that you just criticize or drag your feet. If you make a
counterproposal, then your new PR becomes the expected outcome of the contribution
thread until 7 days have elapsed on _it_, or until a _new_ counterproposal
materializes. Ping-pong proposals that just reassert an entrenched position
stall a contribution thread and require a meeting to resolve. We'll handle
that situation as it arises.


This vote process is specifically limited to contributors to encourage contributions to the repository. If this process is found to not be working (e.g. to process intensive, someone is gaming the system, etc) then a different governance process should be considered that adhere to the core principles and addresses the concerns. This can be done via the PR process listed above for now.

Latstly, Everybody plays by these rules, **including maintainers**. And anybody can be a
maintainer, if you have good github kung fu and you'll enforce these rules, tally votes, and merge PRs let us know.

**We're all peers and we're building Self-sovereign identity together**
