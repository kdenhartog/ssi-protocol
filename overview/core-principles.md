# Core Principles

## Doacracy

The first and most important principle is that the design of this protocol will be dependent on a doacracry. The people who are actually contributing to the design of the protocol are the people who get to decide how a particular part of the protocol should be implemented. This is an important foundation to building this protocol because too often, people get caught up in technical discussions that go around in circles and then little work is actually completed. As such, we've decide that the people who are actually making pull requests are the people who will get a say in how things get built. It should be noted that this doesn't mean that we shouldn't have technical discussions. Rather, it implies that if you are going to have discussions to reach consensus on how the protocol should work, then there should be a follow up pull request submitting the ideas discussed into this repository.

## Privacy by Design

One of the a most inportat principles is privacy by design and privacy by default. This is absolutely necessary because privacy cannot be patched in. In order for the identity owner to retain ownership and control of their data, privacy must be built in at every layer of the protocol. Without this, the user will slowly lose control of their data as third party actors discover ways to extract and correlate information from the protocol at all layers. Therefore it is absolutely necessary for this protocol to be designed with privacy, and privacy must be the default setting. If an identity owner wishes to share information about themselves publicly and to the world that is their choice. 

## Interoperability

Without interoperability we're just building the next iteration of what we have. A fragmented market of isolated, siloed, and broken identity systems. Interoperability is a key foundation to this protocol because it's what allows us to pass messages and data no matter the parties involved in the conversation. The goal of this protocol is to enable an identity system that creates an identity system that every person can use and can trust. This means that the solution and success lies in the ability to create a common userbase of the entire human population. Once we've established this common userbase competition of ideas can and is encouraged at the higher layers to produce the best ideas. However at these base layers of the self-sovereign identity system, interoperability is more important than business models and economic moats. This protocol should be viewed as important as the TCP protocol is to the internet and when done right, it will make a common place for us to build self-sovereign identity together.

## Extensible

It is the goal of this protocol to be technically extensible in order to continue to adapt to the changing landscape of the self-sovereign identity movement. This is necessary to build a system that best fits the users of the system and to continue to adapt to their needs. This means that the protocol should be designed modularly, so that pieces can be interchanged if necessary as well as new pieces can be easily added on top to extend the protocol. Extensibility is also important to encourage quick work and reduce complexity.

## User-Centric

This principle is essential to developing any piece of software for a large user base. It is important that we don't enforce our world view on the users, rather we extend the capabilities of this protocol such that the user has the option to select in which ever way they choose. This also means that we must default to the most safe, and risk adverse settings, but make it easy for the user to change and adapt their usage of this protocol to their desires. In order for this protocol to be adapted to many cultures and subsections of the human population, we must consider other world views that may be in direct contention of our own beliefs. If it does, we shall refer back to this principle to guide our decision-making.

## Respectful

When build technologies it's important that we recognize that not everyone will hold the same beliefs, ideas, and world views, but this shouldn't prevent us from being respectful as we disagree and compromise on a solution. Most often the technical issues that are encountered when building technologies are rooted in a difference in beliefs - in other words, they are a difference in people not technologies. By recognizing that our differences are rooted in a difference of beliefs, we can maintain respect for each others paths as we build these new technologies.
